## Overview
We employ sequence-based methods to identify proteins that have similar structures to queried viral proteins and then use structural alignment to find “structural neighbors” of viral proteins. We applied the approach to a set of 337,493 viral proteins representing 7,486 viruses across a broad host taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Our survey identified over 6,000,000 structural relationships between proteins in viruses and non-viral organisms.

## Data|results
Description of all structural relationships inferred involving viral and non-viral proteins and data generated to make the figures in the manuscxript.

## Scripts
Scripts (and the associated outcome) used to compute taxonomic enrichments and cluster viral families (human-infecting viruses) based on their human biological pathways potentially targeted through structural mimicry.
