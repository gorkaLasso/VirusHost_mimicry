# pathway_enrichment_humanVirFam

For each viral family, the space of structural neighbors was used for enrichment analysis. Enrichment of biological pathways was determined using David, background corrected using the 5,841 human protein structures extracted from PDB. A Bonferroni corrected p-value < 0.01 was used to identify enriched biological ontologies. Viral families and biological pathways enriched in at least one viral family were clustered using R and the heatmap.2 function within gplots package (values in original matrix: -log10 P-valueBonferroni; distance metric: Euclidean, method: complete).
