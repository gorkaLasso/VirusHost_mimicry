# Human infecting viral families

## count

Tab delimited text files (one file per viral family) describing the percentage of viruses within a viral family that structurally mimic a particular human protein (at least one viral protein must be structurally similar to the human protein)

* Column 0

     Human protein (Uniprot AC) mimicking >= 1 viruses within the viral family

* Column 1

     Number of viruses within the family structurally mimicking the human protein

* Column 2

     Total number of viruses within a viral family

* Column 3

     Percentages of viruses within the family structurally mimicking the human protein
