## human_infecting_viral_families

Description of human proteins being structurally mimicked within viral families of human-infecting viruses

## mapping
Mapping of viral proteins, viruses and their hosts as described by virushostDB 
 
## virus_host_structural_pairs

Tab delimited text files describing structural relationships between viral proteins and proteins in non-viral organisms. Each file within the directory corresponds to a set of viruses grouped together according to the taxonomic division of their host.

Important! The run for SARS-CoV-2 proteins was carried out using an updated version of the PDB. Therefore, human proteins mimicking SARS-CoV-2 but not other coronaviruses might be the result of having used a more up-to-date database.
